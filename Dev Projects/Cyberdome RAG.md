# Technical Understanding of the project


## Catalog Composition
The NIST_SP-800-53_rev5_catalog.json catalog is actually is the combination of: 
1. **SP 800-53** Rev 5.2 Controls - which supplies Controls, statements, guidance(Discussion in pdf version), and enhancements
2. **SP 800‑53A** Rev 5.2 Assessment Procedures. - which supplies the assessment-objective, examine, interview and test parts.

Each control in the OSCAL JSON catalog is described by:

- **id** — Code of the control. e.g. `ac-2`, `ac-2.1`. 
- **class** — Typically `SP800-53` for base controls and `SP800-53-enhancement` for enhancements. 
- **title** — Human-readable name of the control (e.g. "Account Management").
- **params** — Parameter placeholders referenced from prose via `{{ insert: param, <id> }}`. Organizations supply concrete values when tailoring a baseline for themselves(e.g. retention period, role names).
- **props** — Key/value metadata tags attached to the control or its parts. Common names: `label` (display label like `AC-2`), `sort-id`, `status` (e.g. `withdrawn`), and assessment-method markers. Used for filtering, sorting, and rendering.
- **links** — Cross-references to related items via `href` (often `#<id>`) and `rel` (e.g. `related`, `required`, `reference`, `incorporated-into`). Drives the control-relationship graph and citations to source documents.
- **parts** — The structured prose of the control, organized as a tree of named segments. Key `name` values:
  - `statement` — the normative control text (with nested `item` parts for sub-statements a., b., c., …).
  - `guidance` — supplemental discussion (the "Discussion" section in the PDF).
  - `objective` / `assessment-objective` — what an assessor must determine (from SP 800-53A).
  - `examine`, `interview`, `test` — assessment methods and objects (from SP 800-53A).
  Each part may carry its own `id`, `props`, `links`, `prose`, and nested `parts`.
- **controls** — Nested child controls representing **enhancements** (e.g. `ac-2.1`, `ac-2.2`). Recursively share the same schema as their parent.

## Oscal Controls vs Platform Evidence

**oscal_controls**
Chunks of OSCAL / NIST control catalog text (requirements, statements, etc.)
`core/intelligence`: retrieves and analyzes platform evidence
*Query Path:*  VectorStoreService.search() → EmbeddingClient → Qdrant → returns control-oriented results (no Postgres join for the chunk text itself in the same way)


**platform_evidence**
Vectors tied to platform_evidence rows — operational evidence (logs, findings payloads, connector output, etc.)
`core/ai`: Use models to generate answers from prompts optionally grounded by `core/intelligence`
*Query Path:* EvidenceSearchService.search_semantic() → embed query → Qdrant → then load matching rows from Postgres by evidence id


## Execution Flow of RAG for the OSCAL Controls

The pipeline runs in three groups of layers:

- **Offline indexing** (Parse → Layer 1 Flatten → Layer 2 Chunk → Layer 3 Embed → Layer 4 Store) — a batch job, kicked off by `scripts/index_oscal_vectors.py`, that turns the raw OSCAL catalog into vectors sitting in Qdrant. Nothing can be retrieved until it has run.
- **Online query** (Layer 5 Search → Layer 6 Inference) — runs per HTTP request: embed the question, retrieve the nearest chunks, and (for RAG) generate a grounded answer.
- **Delivery & operations surface** (Layer 7 Frontend page → Layer 8 Pickers & health → Layer 9 Answer rendering → Layer 10 Model management → Layer 11 Admin reindex) — the React "Compliance Q&A" page and the admin endpoints that drive it. This is the part a user actually touches: it chooses the embedding profile and chat model per request, shows whether the index is reachable, renders answers with clickable citations, and lets an operator pull/remove Ollama models or trigger a reindex from the browser.

~~The first thread (Parse → Layer 6) is what *produces* an answer; the second (Layers 7–11) is what *lets a human ask for one and manage the moving parts*. Read end to end, control starts at the indexer, comes to rest in Qdrant, and then — on a user's click in Layer 7 — flows back out through the query layers and returns to the screen in Layer 9.~~

Each step below is one element of that flow and has two components: **What this step does** (its intent) and **Control flow (start → end)** (how and why control moves to the next element — the gateways, function calls, and objects involved). A function's or class's home file is named the first time it appears and is not repeated afterward. All UI calls go through `api.get` / `api.post` in `frontend/src/api/client.ts`, which prefixes the `/api` base — so a path written here as `/v1/search/ask` hits the backend's `/api/v1/search/ask`.

#### Parse (precedes Layer 1)

**What this step does:** Read the raw OSCAL catalog JSON once and turn it into a structured `OscalCatalog` object, so no later layer walks the raw JSON again. The result carries the whole control tree (base controls plus nested enhancements) and, on each control, its `statement`, `guidance`, `params`, and extracted `assessment_parts`.

**Control flow (start → end):**

1. `scripts/index_oscal_vectors.py` builds a `VectorStoreService` and calls `index_catalog_path()`, which calls `parse_oscal_catalog()` in `core/frameworks/oscal_parser.py` to read the catalog JSON.

2. `parse_oscal_catalog()` walks the catalog's `groups` and, for every control in a group, calls `_parse_control()` with the group id as the `family`.

3. `_parse_control()` returns an `OscalControl`, filling `id`, `title`, `family`, `statement` and `guidance` (both via `_extract_prose(parts, name)`), `params` (straight from `raw["params"]`), and `parent_control_id`. It then recurses into each child under the control's `controls` key, so enhancements like `ac-2.1` become nested `OscalControl` objects in the `enhancements` list, each tagged with its `parent_control_id`.

4. For the assessment text, `_parse_control()` calls `_collect_named_parts()` with the target set `ASSESSMENT_PART_NAMES = {"assessment-objective", "examine", "interview", "test"}`. It recursively walks the control's `parts` tree and, for each part whose `name` is in that set and that has prose, appends an `OscalControlPart` preserving its `id`, `name`, `prose`, and `label` (via `_extract_label()`).

5. The `prose` for each collected part comes from `_collect_prose()`, which recursively concatenates the part's own prose with the prose of every descendant part. Because `_collect_named_parts()` keeps recursing into `part["parts"]` afterward, a parent objective and its children can each become their own `OscalControlPart`: the parent's prose holds the combined child text, and the children also appear as separate parts.

6. After all groups are parsed, `parse_oscal_catalog()` returns an `OscalCatalog` (`uuid`, `title`, `version`, `families`) whose tree already contains parsed enhancements and per-control `assessment_parts`.

7. As a result, later layers operate on typed `OscalCatalog`, `OscalControl`, and `OscalControlPart` objects rather than raw JSON.

#### Layer 1: Flatten

**What this step does:** Collapse the nested control tree into a single flat list of controls (base controls and enhancements together) so the chunker can process one control at a time, without losing the enhancement→parent link.

**Control flow (start → end):**

1. The indexer (Layer 3) calls `OscalCatalog.flatten_controls()` on the parsed catalog.

2. `flatten_controls()` iterates each `OscalFamily` in `self.families` and, for every base control in `family.controls`, appends the control to the result list and then calls `_flatten_enhancements(control, result)`.

3. `_flatten_enhancements()` recursively walks the control's `enhancements`, appending each one (and its nested enhancements) to the same flat list, so every base control and every nested enhancement lands in the output as its own `OscalControl`.

4. Enhancements keep their `parent_control_id`, so the base-control relationship survives flattening; each control also still carries its own `assessment_parts` (the parts are never flattened into a separate list).

5. As a result, the flat `list[OscalControl]` lets later layers treat base controls and enhancements uniformly while preserving both the enhancement→parent link (`parent_control_id`) and the control→part link (`assessment_parts`).

#### Layer 2: Chunk

**What this step does:** Expand each control into one or more self-contained, embedding-ready `ControlChunk` objects — separating the control's `statement`, each `assessment-objective`, and its `guidance` into distinct chunks so retrieval can return and cite text at a fine granularity.

**Control flow (start → end):**

1. For each `OscalControl` from Layer 1, `build_control_chunks(control, catalog)` in `core/frameworks/embedding_formatter.py` produces its chunks. It draws on two sources: the control's own `statement`/`guidance` strings, and the `OscalControlPart` items in `control.assessment_parts` collected during Parse.

2. It emits chunks in this order, each stamped with a `chunk_type`:
  - **statement** — one chunk from `control.statement` (when present)
  - **guidance** — one chunk from `control.guidance` (when present)
  - one chunk per `OscalControlPart` in `control.assessment_parts`, whose `chunk_type` is the part's own `name` (e.g. `assessment-objective`)

3. Because Parse collected a parent objective and its children as separate `OscalControlPart` entries (with the parent's prose already containing the combined child text via `_collect_prose()`), the assessment chunks are overlapping and fine-grained. For example, objectives `pt-8_obj.b`, `pt-8_obj.b-1`, and `pt-8_obj.b-2` become three chunks: `pt-8_obj.b` (whose prose contains `b-1` and `b-2`), plus `b-1` and `b-2` on their own. This is what lets a grounded answer cite a precise sub-objective like `[AC-2.3_obj.a]`.

4. For every chunk, `build_control_chunks()` prepares the text:
  - `resolve_param_inserts(content, control.params)` replaces `{{ insert: param, ... }}` tokens with human-readable values derived from the control's `params`
  - `_format_chunk_text()` prepends self-contained headers (`Control ID`, `Control Title`, `Family`, `Chunk Type`, and, for assessment chunks, `Part ID` then `Part Label`) to the resolved body

5. Each chunk is returned as a `ControlChunk` with two fields: `text` (the formatted body to embed) and `metadata`, a `ControlChunkMetadata` carrying `control_id`, `family`, `parent_control_id`, `part_id`, `chunk_type`, `catalog_version`, and `catalog_uuid`.

6. As a result, Layer 2 turns one control into several self-contained chunks, each independently retrievable and citable.


#### Layer 3: Embed

**What this step does:** Convert each new chunk's text into an embedding vector, skipping chunks already indexed, while keeping every vector paired with its originating `ControlChunk`.

**Control flow (start → end):**

1. `OscalVectorIndexer.index_catalog()` in `core/frameworks/vector_indexer.py` first builds the chunk list via `_catalog_chunks()`, which runs Layer 1's `flatten_controls()` then Layer 2's `build_control_chunks()` for each control.

2. For each chunk it computes `_stable_point_id()` — a deterministic UUID derived from a SHA-256 of `catalog_uuid`, `catalog_version`, `control_id`, `part_id`, `chunk_type`, and `text` — so identical content always maps to the same Qdrant point.

3. `_get_existing_ids()` retrieves which of those IDs already exist in the collection; chunks whose ID is already present are dropped, so unchanged content is never re-embedded.

4. For the remaining new chunks, `index_catalog()` calls `EmbeddingClient.embed_texts()` in `core/frameworks/embedding_client.py` with the chunk texts.

5. `embed_texts()` batches the texts by `EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE` and POSTs them to the configured provider (Ollama's `/api/embed` or OpenAI's `/v1/embeddings`), with retry/backoff on transient failures, returning one vector per text.

6. As a result, Layer 3 yields a list of vectors aligned one-to-one with the new `ControlChunk` objects, ready to be combined with their metadata into Qdrant points.

#### Layer 4: Vector indexing / storage

**What this step does:** Write each (vector, payload) pair into the Qdrant collection that belongs to the active embedding profile, so the chunks become searchable and filterable. This closes the offline indexing phase.

**Control flow (start → end):**

1. `VectorStoreService.index_catalog()` in `core/ai/vector_store.py` routes the write through the selected profile's bundle to `OscalVectorIndexer`. The indexer calls `ensure_collection(vector_size)` to create the collection (with `Distance.COSINE`) on first use and to add payload indexes on `control_id`, `family`, `catalog_uuid`, etc.

2. For each chunk, `_to_point()` builds a Qdrant `PointStruct` with two parts:
  - the **vector** from Layer 3
  - the **payload**, the chunk's metadata plus its `text` (`control_id`, `family`, `catalog_uuid`, `chunk_type`, `text`, `catalog_version`, …) — this is what makes filtered retrieval possible later

3. Points are upserted in batches of 100. *Which* collection they land in depends on the active **embedding profile**: an `EmbeddingProfile` (built by `build_profiles()` in `core/ai/embedding_profiles.py`) pairs a provider + model with its own collection, because vectors from different models have different dimensions and cannot share a collection. `VectorStoreService` holds one embedder/indexer bundle per profile, and `_select(profile)` routes the write — the **default** profile reuses the legacy `oscal_controls` collection (so upgrading needs no re-index), while every other profile gets a namespaced `oscal_controls__{profile}` (e.g. `oscal_controls__openai_text_embedding_3_small`). This is why `EmbeddingClient` accepts `provider`/`model` overrides: one `Settings` instance yields a distinct embedder per profile.

4. As a result, Qdrant now holds each chunk as a searchable vector plus structured payload. The payload is what lets Layer 5 narrow a search to only points whose metadata matches a framework, family, or control ID rather than scanning every point.

#### Layer 5: Search / retrieval

**What this step does:** On each request, embed the user's query with the same profile used at index time and return the nearest control chunks from Qdrant — the retrieval half of the online query phase.

**Control flow (start → end):**

1. **API gateway:** `create_app()` in `core/app.py` mounts the `vector_search` router under `/api/v1`, so `GET /api/v1/search/controls` is routed by FastAPI to `search_controls()` in `core/routes/vector_search.py`. (The same router exposes `GET /search/profiles` and `GET /health/qdrant`, which the UI calls to populate its profile picker and index-status badge.)

2. `search_controls()` reads the query from `q` and optional `framework`/`family`/`control` filters, packs them into a `SearchFilters` object (`core/ai/vector_store.py`), and calls `VectorStoreService.search()` with `q`, `filters`, `top_k`, and the requested `profile`. The service instance is reused across requests via the `_get_vector_service()` dependency, which caches it on `app.state`.

3. `search()` calls `_select(profile)` to pick that profile's embedder and collection, then calls `EmbeddingClient.embed_texts()` to turn the query into a vector — using the same model that produced the stored vectors, so cosine comparison is meaningful.

4. `_build_filter()` converts the `SearchFilters` into a Qdrant `Filter` of `FieldCondition` objects: `framework`→`catalog_uuid`, `family`→`family`, `control`→`control_id`. When filters are present, Qdrant restricts the search to matching points instead of scanning the whole collection.

5. `search()` calls `QdrantClient.query_points()` (qdrant-client 1.7+ replaced `.search()`) with the query vector, filter, and `top_k`, against the profile's collection.

6. Each returned hit is mapped by `_hit_to_result()` into a `ControlSearchResult` — `control_id`, `family`, `chunk_type`, `text`, `catalog_version`, plus the similarity `score` — drawn from the payload stored in Layer 4.

7. `search_controls()` wraps the list in a `ControlSearchResponse` (query, results, total) and returns it. The API hands back plain text plus metadata, never raw vectors.



#### Layer 6: Inference (LLM)

**What this step does:** Turn the retrieved chunks into a grounded, citation-bearing answer — the generation half of the online query phase, reached via `POST /api/v1/search/ask`. The chat model sees **only text**, never vectors, so swapping the chat model needs no re-indexing, whereas changing the *embedding* model means re-running Layers 3–4 (reindex) so stored and query vectors match.

**Control flow (start → end):**

1. **API gateway:** `POST /api/v1/search/ask` (body validated against the `AskRequest` model) routes to `ask()` in `core/routes/vector_search.py`, which calls `VectorStoreService.ask()` with the question, filters, `top_k`, an optional `model` override, and `profile`.

2. `ask()` first runs Layer 5's `search()` to retrieve chunks, and builds the `citations` list directly from those retrieved chunks — never from LLM output — so a citation can only reference a control that was actually retrieved. If nothing is retrieved, it returns early with an `"Insufficient evidence: …"` `GroundedAnswer` and makes no LLM call.

3. Otherwise it assembles the prompt: `_build_control_context()` concatenates the chunk texts into a bounded context string, and `_build_rag_messages()` combines that with `_RAG_SYSTEM_PROMPT` / `_RAG_USER_TEMPLATE` (all in `core/ai/vector_store.py`). The system prompt enforces grounding rules, including citing a fine-grained ID like `[AC-2.3_obj.a]` only when that exact string appears in the context.

4. `_resolve_rag_provider()` picks the chat model and credentials (default priority OpenAI → Anthropic → Ollama; a `model` override re-routes accordingly), and `ask()` calls `litellm.acompletion()` with that model and the messages.

5. `ask()` returns a `GroundedAnswer` (answer text, citations, `model_used`, `chunks_used`). If the provider call fails, the `ask()` route translates the error into a precise HTTP status (e.g. 422 for an unknown model, 503 for an unreachable provider) for the UI.

> Note: this OSCAL Q&A path uses `VectorStoreService.ask()`. A separate `AIEngine` (`core/ai/engine.py`) backs other product flows and may additionally require `AI_FEATURES_ENABLED=True` in `core/config.py`.

#### Layer 7: Frontend — the Compliance Q&A page

**What this step does:** Give the user a single page to ask a question, with a switch between full RAG and retrieval-only, and own the form state and submit lifecycle that calls Layers 5/6.

**Control flow (start → end):**

1. **Route entry:** the `/search` route is registered in `frontend/src/router.tsx` (`searchRoute`, nested under `layoutRoute` so it requires auth), lazy-loading the default export `SearchPage` from `frontend/src/pages/search/search.tsx`. The sidebar links to it as "Compliance Q&A" (`frontend/src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`).

2. `SearchPage` holds one `AskFormState` (`question`, `family`, `controlId`, `topK`, `model`, `profile`) initialized from `DEFAULT_FORM`, plus a `tab` of `"ask" | "search"`. A `<Tabs>` toggles between **Ask (RAG)** and **Retrieval only**; the same form serves both, only the max length and chunk cap differ.

3. On submit, `handleSubmit()` branches on `tab`. For `"ask"` it builds an `AskRequest` via `buildAskRequest()` (mapping the `__any__` family and blank fields to `null`) and fires `askMutation`, whose `mutationFn` calls `api.post<GroundedAnswer>("/v1/search/ask", req)` — entering **Layer 6**. For `"search"` it builds a query string via `buildSearchParams()` and fires `searchMutation`, which calls `api.get<ControlSearchResponse>("/v1/search/controls?…")` — entering **Layer 5**. Each path `.reset()`s its mutation first so a stale answer never lingers under a new question.

4. The mutation owns the async state (`isPending`, `error`, `data`); the JSX below the form renders off it. Control returns to the page when the backend responds, handed to Layer 9 for display.

#### Layer 8: Frontend — profile picker, model dropdown, and index health

**What this step does:** Let the user pick *which* embedding profile and *which* chat model a request uses, and show whether the chosen profile's Qdrant collection is actually reachable — all sourced from the backend so the UI never hardcodes what's available.

**Control flow (start → end):**

1. **Profiles:** `profilesQuery` calls `api.get<ProfilesListResponse>("/v1/search/profiles")`. On the backend, `list_profiles()` in `core/routes/vector_search.py` returns `svc.list_profiles()` mapped to `EmbeddingProfileResponse` rows (`name`, `provider`, `model`, `collection`, `description`, `available`, `is_default`). The `<Select>` lists every profile but disables those with `available=false` (provider not configured), and shows the active profile's `collection`/`provider` beneath it. A `useEffect` pre-fills `form.profile` with the server `default` once known, so the dropdown shows the resolved name rather than a blank "default".

2. **Models:** `modelsQuery` calls `api.get<ModelsListResponse>("/v1/search/models")`. `list_models()` builds the list from the **curated catalog** in `core/ai/model_catalog.py` (`OPENAI_CHAT_MODELS`, `ANTHROPIC_CHAT_MODELS`, `OLLAMA_CHAT_MODELS`) — *not* raw Ollama `/api/tags` — so embedding-only models like `nomic-embed-text` never appear as chat options. Hosted models are listed only when their `AI_*_ENABLED` flag and API key are set (`installed=true` always); for each Ollama model, `_fetch_ollama_models()` hits Ollama's `/api/tags` to set `installed`, letting the UI offer a "pull" action. The default is computed to mirror `_resolve_rag_provider` (OpenAI → Anthropic → Ollama). The dropdown shows "Server default · <id>" plus every `installed` model; selecting the default sends `model: null`.

3. **Index health:** the `QdrantStatus` badge calls `api.get<QdrantHealthResponse>("/v1/health/qdrant?profile=…")` for the *active* profile. `qdrant_health()` calls `svc.collection_info(profile)` and **always returns HTTP 200** — the badge reads `qdrant_reachable` and `collection.points_count` to render "N chunks indexed", "index degraded", or "index unreachable". This is why a missing index shows as a calm badge rather than a thrown error.

#### Layer 9: Frontend — rendering the grounded answer

**What this step does:** Turn the `GroundedAnswer` (or `ControlSearchResponse`) into readable output: prose with inline citation chips, a citation list, and a distinct treatment for "insufficient evidence".

**Control flow (start → end):**

1. When `askMutation` resolves, the answer card renders. `insufficient` is `true` when `answer` starts with `INSUFFICIENT_PREFIX` ("Insufficient evidence"); that flips the card to an amber warning style instead of the blue "Grounded answer" style, and surfaces `model_used` and `chunks_used` in the header.

2. The answer text goes through the `AnswerText` component, which runs a regex over the string to find `[AC-2]`-style control IDs (including enhancement/sub-objective forms like `[AC-2(3)]` / `[AC-2.3_obj.a]`) and renders each match as an inline `<Badge>` chip, leaving the rest as plain text. This is the front-end half of the grounding contract: the backend guarantees the IDs are real (citations built from retrieved chunks in Layer 6), and the UI makes them visually scannable.

3. Below the answer, each item in `askAnswer.citations` renders as a `CitationCard` (control ID, `chunk_type`, similarity `score` with a color band from `scoreBadgeClass()`, and the `text_excerpt`). In the **Retrieval only** tab, `searchResponse.results` render as `ResultCard`s instead — same shape, no LLM answer above them. Empty states and `error` cards cover the no-results and provider-failure paths.

#### Layer 10: Model management — pull / remove Ollama models from the UI

**What this step does:** Let a user make a curated Ollama model usable (pull) or reclaim space (remove) without shell access, and reflect long-running pulls live in the dropdown.

**Control flow (start → end):**

1. The **Manage models** dialog (`ManageOllamaModelsDialog`) lists the Ollama models from Layer 8 with an `installed`/`pulling…` badge. "Pull" fires `pullMutation` → `api.post("/v1/admin/models/pull", { pull_name })`; "Remove" opens a confirm dialog, then fires `removeMutation` → `api.post("/v1/admin/models/remove", { pull_name })`. Both admin endpoints require `require_admin`.

2. **Pull (backend):** `admin_pull_model()` first calls `_validate_catalog_pull_name()` — rejecting any name not in the curated catalog, so the endpoint can't be used to pull arbitrary (huge) models into the shared container. It then `asyncio.create_task(_perform_ollama_pull(...))` and returns **202 Accepted** immediately. `_perform_ollama_pull()` streams Ollama's `/api/pull` to completion, then calls `_evict_model_cache()` to free the just-pulled model from the OS page cache so it has RAM to load into (see the sidebar **"Freeing the page cache after a pull"** below for how this works).

3. **Live updates:** because the pull is fire-and-forget, the UI tracks it in a `pendingPulls` set (added in `pullMutation.onSuccess`). While that set is non-empty, `modelsQuery` sets `refetchInterval: 3000`, re-polling `/v1/search/models` every 3 s; a `useEffect` drops a name from `pendingPulls` once the model reports `installed`, which stops the polling. Another `useEffect` falls the selected `model` back to the server default if the currently-chosen model is removed.

4. **Remove (backend):** `admin_remove_model()` re-validates against the catalog, then issues `DELETE /api/delete` to Ollama, translating 404 (not installed) and other failures into precise HTTP codes; `removeMutation.onSuccess` invalidates the `chat-models` query so the dropdown refreshes.

---

**Sidebar — freeing the page cache after a pull (`_evict_model_cache`)**

*The concept everything hinges on — the page cache.* When a program reads or writes a file, the OS keeps a copy of that file's contents in RAM so the next access is fast. That in-RAM copy is the **page cache** ("page" = one ~4 KB chunk the OS manages memory in; the page cache is the collection of pages currently holding file data). It's normally invisible and helpful.

*Why this code exists.* When Ollama *pulls* a model, the OS fills the page cache with that big model file. RAM then looks "used" even though the real copy is safely on disk. Ollama decides whether it can load a model by checking roughly *free* RAM and does **not** count reclaimable *Available* cache as free — so right after a download it can **refuse to load the model it just pulled**. The fix: evict that file's pages from the page cache so the RAM reads as free again. `_evict_model_cache()` (`core/routes/vector_search.py:537`) does this. It's run via `await asyncio.to_thread(_evict_model_cache, ...)` — i.e. on a **separate worker thread**, because the steps below are slow, blocking disk operations and the async server's event loop must never get stuck.

The three steps that matter regarding this in control-flow order:

1. **`os.sync()` — flush first, so pages are safe to drop.** Some cached pages may be *dirty* (written in RAM but not yet saved to disk). A dirty page can't be safely dropped — that would lose data. `os.sync()` forces the OS to write all pending changes to disk *now*, turning every dirty page *clean*. A clean page is just a redundant copy of what's on disk, so it's safe to throw away. This is the "make everything evictable" step, and it must come before eviction.

2. **`os.posix_fadvise(fd, 0, 0, os.POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)` — the actual eviction.** `fadvise` = "file advice": telling the OS how you'll use a file so it can manage the cache. The args: `fd` is a handle to the open file; `0, 0` is offset + length, where the second `0` means **the whole file** (not zero bytes); `POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED` is the advice **"I won't need this file's data again soon."** In response the OS **drops that file's clean pages from the page cache** — reclaiming the RAM. (Linux/Unix only — on macOS this function doesn't exist, so the whole routine no-ops.)

3. **Targeting only our own files (`os.scandir` + `entry.is_file()` + `os.open`/`os.close`).** Rather than the blunt, privileged, system-wide `drop_caches`, the code evicts *only Ollama's model files*: `os.scandir({models_path}/models/blobs)` lists the blob files; `entry.is_file()` skips sub-directories (a folder has no file-content pages to evict); `os.open(path, os.O_RDONLY)` gets a read-only **file descriptor** (a small integer handle the OS uses to refer to an open file) to pass to `fadvise`; `os.close(fd)` in a `finally` releases that handle even on error, so looping over thousands of blobs can't leak handles. Read-only is enough — evicting cache doesn't modify the file.

*How the backend can even see Ollama's files.* The two run in separate containers, so this only works because of `docker-compose.yml` (lines 50–52): the backend mounts the shared `ollama_data` volume **read-only** at `/ollama-models`, and `OLLAMA_MODELS_PATH=/ollama-models` (config default is empty — `core/config.py:44`) points the eviction at it.

*Safety / no-op conditions (so it never breaks a pull).* The function returns early and does nothing when `OLLAMA_MODELS_PATH` is unset (local non-Docker runs), when `os.posix_fadvise` is unavailable (macOS), or when the blobs dir is absent; per-file `OSError`s are caught and logged. It's designed to be safe to call unconditionally and never raise into the pull.

docker run --rm --privileged alpine sh -c 'sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'

# Seeing if the cache freed up
docker exec -it $(docker compose ps -q ollama) free -h
```

#### Layer 11: Admin reindex

**What this step does:** Re-run the offline indexing phase (Layers 1–4) on demand from the API, without dropping to the CLI — useful after adding catalogs or switching a profile's embedding model.

**Control flow (start → end):**

1. `POST /v1/admin/reindex` (body `ReindexRequest`: `force`, `oscal_dir`, `profile`) routes to `admin_reindex()`, gated by `require_admin`.

2. It resolves the OSCAL directory (defaulting to `data/oscal/` at repo root) and calls `VectorStoreService.reindex(oscal_path, force=…, profile=…)` — the same service method the CLI uses. With `force=true` the profile's collection is deleted and recreated for a clean index; otherwise the stable-ID skip from Layer 3 makes the re-run idempotent.

3. It returns a `ReindexResponse` (`catalogs_indexed`, `total_chunks`, `catalog_titles`, `force`). The docstring notes this runs synchronously and can take minutes for large catalogs, so the CLI (`scripts/index_oscal_vectors.py`) remains the preferred path for production bulk indexing.

## Manual CLI RAG Setup:

Step 1: Set up the docker containers
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Step 2: Pull the embedding model and the chat model inside the Ollama container so it can serve them locally (the `ollama` CLI lives inside the container, not on the host)
```bash
docker exec -it cyberdome-ollama-1 ollama pull nomic-embed-text # replace `nomic-embed-text` with a different model like `mxbai-embed-large` for testing a different embedding model. But remember - you will have to build a different embedding profile for that. 
docker exec -it cyberdome-ollama-1 ollama pull llama3.1  # replace `llama 3.1` with a different model like `qwen3:8b` for testing a different chat model
```

Step 3: Create a fresh project virtualenv using Python 3.13 (the project's `pyproject.toml` requires `>=3.13`; the default `python3` on macOS may be 3.12), activate it, verify Python is pointing at the venv at the right version, then install the project + dev dependencies so the next Python command has everything it needs
```bash
rm -rf .venv
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
which python && python --version          # should print .../.venv/bin/python and Python 3.13.x
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Step 4: Index the OSCAL catalog into Qdrant so the control chunks are embedded and stored for retrieval (`--force` drops and recreates the collection for a clean state)
```bash
python scripts/index_oscal_vectors.py --list-profiles # Confirm both profiles report AVAIL=yes
python scripts/index_oscal_vectors.py --force # Index using the default profile(ollama_nomic_embed_text) results in a collection named `oscal_vectors`
python scripts/index_oscal_vectors.py --profile openai_text_embedding_3_small --force # Index using the openAI profile results in a collection named `oscal_controls__openai_text_embedding_3_small`
```

Step 5: Verify both collections are populated
curl -s 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/qdrant?profile=ollama_nomic_embed_text' | jq
curl -s 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/qdrant?profile=openai_text_embedding_3_small' | jq


Step 6: Start the FastAPI backend so the search and ask endpoints become reachable
```bash
uvicorn core.app:create_app --factory --reload --port 8000
```

Step 7: Run a semantic search against the indexed controls to confirm retrieval is working end-to-end
```bash
curl -sG 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search/controls' \
    --data-urlencode 'q=What does the control baseline require for account management?' \
    --data-urlencode 'top_k=5' | jq .
```

Step 8: Ask a grounded RAG question using 2 models on the collections made from the 2 profiles—
```bash
Q='What does AC-2 require for inactive account disablement?'

  for MODEL in 'ollama_chat/llama3.1' 'gpt-4o-mini'; do
    for PROFILE in ollama_nomic_embed_text openai_text_embedding_3_small; do
      echo "=== model=$MODEL  profile=$PROFILE ==="
      curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search/ask \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d "{\"question\":\"$Q\",\"profile\":\"$PROFILE\",\"model\":\"$MODEL\",\"top_k\":5}" \
        | jq '{model_used, chunks_used, citations:[.citations[] | {control_id, score}], answer}'
    done
  done
```

## Sample questions for testing embedding profiles and models

1. **Prompt:** What does AC-2 require for inactive account disablement?
  - **Tests:** Basic control retrieval and summarization.

2. **Prompt:** How does AC-2(3) differ from AC-2?
  - **Tests:** Retrieval of control enhancements and comparison.

3. **Prompt:** Which controls support multifactor authentication, and how are they related?
  - **Tests:** Multi-control retrieval and reasoning.

4. **Prompt:** What evidence would an auditor expect to see to assess compliance with AU-6?
  - **Tests:** Conversion of control text into compliance guidance.

5. **Prompt:** Which controls are relevant to privileged account management, and why?
  - **Tests:** Thematic retrieval across multiple families.

6. **Prompt:** Build a table of controls related to remote access, including their control families and purposes.
  - **Tests:** Aggregation, organization, and synthesis.

### Prompts that return Insufficient evidence

1. **Prompt:** What organization-defined parameters exist in IA-5?
  - **Tests:** OSCAL-specific structured data retrieval.

2. **Prompt:** Is AC-2 included in the Moderate baseline?
  - **Tests:** Baseline/profile awareness.

3. **Prompt:** What does control AC-999 require?
  - **Tests:** Hallucination resistance and ability to recognize nonexistent controls.
