## Language Models as Knowledge Bases

A **knowledge base** is an organized collection of information that a system can consult to answer queries or perform reasoning.

The term describes the purpose that the information serves, rather than a specific storage technology. The actual storage technology could be relational databases, non-relational databases(such as document stores, graph database), vector indexes, or a combination of these.

A **knowledge graph** is a conceptual data model idea that represents entities as nodes and relationships in between them as edges between the nodes. You could implement the same conceptual data model using a relational database, a document database, or a graph database.

A fact in a knowledge graph can be represented as a (subject, relation, object) triple, such as (Dante, born-in, Florence).

## Sept 18th Discussion Paper

**Paper:** MindTrellis: Co-Creating Knowledge Structures with AI through Interactive Visual Exploration

**Mind maps** are visual diagrams used to organize ideas around a central topic. Kind of like a flow chart / Knowledge graph that has the main idea in the center and nodes flow outward. Tools like XMind, Miro, MindMeister, etc let you draw these through a GUI.

### Questions

1. They do talk about Notion in the paper, but at first glance, MindTrellis reminded me of Obsidian, and I thought of it as kind of a high-level UI for things you can already do in Obsidian by manually writing links like `[[Note Name]]` inside your notes to get a knowledge graph view, or using Canvas to build a graph with annotated edges.

But on closer inspection, I now feel that it could have its own space in a setup where you keep your actual knowledge base separately in Obsidian, Notion, or just plain .md files in VS Code, and then go to MindTrellis with the relevant documents to build knowledge graphs for concepts that you feel are better represented as a connected topology, in addition to being written about in prose.

2. Marcus also mentioned in the last meeting that he was working on a project that involved building knowledge graphs of different pieces of literature.

Are you thinking of building a tool that can create knowledge graphs comprising of nodes that represent pieces of published literature to visualize how they link to other pieces of literature.

Would the connection established be based on explicit references and the relationship/link being based on the context one piece in which one piece references another in its written material or from inferring implicit topics covered in one that may also be covered in another piece.

The scope of the published material could be limited to one domain like Computer science or agriculture in the beginning.

3. What was the ACL announcement about?
